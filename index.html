      <p>Hi! I'm Kevin, a 3rd year Honours CS undergrad at UBC.
        Currently, I'm a CPSC 210 (Software Construction) TA, and working on a directed study with Dr. Reto Achermann to
        verify the crash consistency of the SQLite pager using <a href="https://rocq-prover.org/">Rocq</a>.
        This summer, I will be working with Dr. Caroline Lemieux on Explotest as part of an NSERC USRA, a tool to turn
        exploratory debugging (print statements, REPL outputs) into unit tests.

        <!-- probably want to get rid of last paragraph at some point. -->
      </p>

      <p>My research interests lie broadly in the areas of Programming Languages and Software Engineering.
        In particular, I am intrigued by type systems, program analysis, and metaprogramming.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>Outside of school, I like to hike, cook, and read.</p> -->
