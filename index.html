  <p>Hi! I'm Kevin, a 3rd year Honours CS undergrad at UBC.
    Currently, I'm a CPSC 210 (Software Construction) TA, and working on a directed study to
    verify the crash consistency of the SQLite pager using <a href="https://rocq-prover.org/">Rocq</a>.
    This summer, I will be working with Dr. Caroline Lemieux on Explotest as part of an NSERC USRA, a tool to turn
    exploratory debugging (print statements, REPL outputs) into unit tests.
  </p>

  <p>I am interested in CS research, particularly in the areas of Programming Languages and Software Engineering.
    I would also be open to a software engineering internship in Fall 2025.
  </p>
